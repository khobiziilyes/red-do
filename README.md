## FAQ

### Why am I writing this file?

This document serves as a comprehensive guide to the Red-Do project. It aims to answer any questions you may have regarding the project's purpose, the technologies employed, the development process, and the reasoning behind design choices. If you find that any of your questions are not addressed here, please don't hesitate to reach out for further clarification.

### Backend Connection and App Functionality

You might wonder why I haven't connected a backend or created a fully functional app. During our interview process, you emphasized the importance of speed and meeting tight deadlines at RedSpot. To demonstrate my ability to deliver quickly, I dedicated three hours to this project only. If you review the commit history, you'll notice that I set up the project and removed the boilerplate a few days ago. I began active development in the last few hours leading up to the deadline.

This project primarily showcases my proficiency in HTML, CSS, React, and TypeScript. Additionally, it highlights the well-structured nature of the codebase.

### Tools I've used?

- React: I chose React for its lightweight nature. If the project had been more complex, I would have considered Angular.
- TypeScript: Self explanatory.
- SWC: I integrated the vite-plugin-react-swc to optimize the project further.
- ReactQuery: While this project doesn't require backend connectivity, ReactQuery would have been my preferred choice for handling API requests in a real-world application.
- Vite: Simply because it's VITE, literally.
- ESLINT: To maintain code quality and adhere to best practices.
- Prettier: For consistent code formatting.
- VSCODE.
- Chrome DevTools.
- Figma Dev Mode.

### Why haven't I used Husky?

You might wonder why I didn't use Husky for code linting and formatting. Husky is a valuable tool, but for this project, I considered it optional and chose to focus on the core aspects.

### Why not a CSS framework?

I intentionally chose not to use a CSS framework for this project to showcase my CSS skills and the ability to create custom styles from scratch.

### Why Vite & not NextJS?

I selected Vite over NextJS because Vite's lightweight build process aligns well with the simplicity of this project. It allowed me to achieve fast development and build times.

### Why haven't I used CSS variables?

Given the project's minimal color requirements, I did not extensively use CSS variables.

### Modular CSS?

Modular CSS was employed to minimize conflicts and maintain a clean code structure.

### Routing?

Due to time limits, I didn't implement routing in this project.

### What did I pay attention to mostly?

Throughout development, I paid particular attention to sizes, responsivity, colors, margins and paddings to ensure a visually pleasing and user-friendly interface.
